# AI Agents Quick Start Guide

## The 30-Minute Path to Your First AI Agent

Stop reading about AI and start using it. This guide cuts through the noise to get you operational fast.

### What You'll Build
A simple customer inquiry agent that:
- Categorizes incoming messages
- Routes to the right department
- Drafts initial responses
- Learns from your corrections

### Prerequisites
- Access to an LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar)
- Basic understanding of APIs
- 30 minutes of focused time

### Step 1: Choose Your Foundation (5 minutes)

Skip the analysis paralysis. Start with one of these:
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Best general purpose, mature ecosystem
- **Anthropic Claude**: Superior for complex reasoning tasks
- **Open source (Llama)**: If data privacy is paramount

### Step 2: Define Your Agent's Scope (10 minutes)

**The 80/20 Rule**: Handle the common cases perfectly, punt the edge cases to humans.

Example scope for a customer service agent:
```
HANDLES:
- Order status inquiries
- Return requests
- Product questions
- Appointment scheduling

ESCALATES:
- Complaints
- Technical issues
- Billing disputes
- Anything it's unsure about
```

### Step 3: Build the Minimum Viable Agent (10 minutes)

```python
import openai

class SimpleAgent:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=api_key)

    def process_inquiry(self, message):
        prompt = f"""
        Categorize this customer message and draft a response.
        If unsure, mark for human review.

        Message: {message}

        Return format:
        Category: [category]
        Confidence: [high/medium/low]
        Response: [your response]
        """

        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]
        )

        return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### Step 4: Test with Real Data (5 minutes)

Use actual customer messages from your last week. The agent should handle 60-80% without human intervention.

### What Success Looks Like

Week 1: Agent handles 20% of inquiries
Week 2: Fine-tune prompts, reach 40%
Week 4: Add context from your knowledge base, hit 60%
Week 8: Customers prefer the agent for simple tasks

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering**: Start simple, iterate based on real usage
2. **Perfectionism**: 80% accuracy that ships beats 99% that doesn't
3. **Ignoring feedback loops**: Every escalation is training data

### Next Steps

Once this is working:
1. Add memory (conversation history)
2. Connect to your existing systems
3. Implement feedback loops
4. Scale to other use cases

### The Bottom Line

You don't need a PhD or a massive budget. You need to start. This guide gets you from zero to functional in 30 minutes.

The perfect agent doesn't exist, but a good-enough agent running today beats a perfect one planned for next quarter.
