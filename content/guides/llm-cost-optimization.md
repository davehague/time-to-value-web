# LLM Cost Optimization Playbook

## How to Cut Your AI Costs by 70% This Week

Your AI bills are too high. Here's how to fix that without degrading performance.

### The Cost Reality Check

Most teams are burning money on:
- Using GPT-4 for tasks GPT-3.5 can handle
- Processing entire documents when summaries would suffice
- Redundant API calls for identical queries
- Not caching responses

### Strategy 1: Model Routing (Save 50% Immediately)

Not every query needs your most expensive model.

```python
def route_query(query, complexity_check):
    if complexity_check(query) == "simple":
        # Use GPT-3.5 Turbo ($0.002/1K tokens)
        return use_gpt35(query)
    elif complexity_check(query) == "moderate":
        # Use GPT-4 Turbo ($0.01/1K tokens)
        return use_gpt4_turbo(query)
    else:
        # Use GPT-4 only when necessary ($0.03/1K tokens)
        return use_gpt4(query)
```

**Simple tasks** (use cheaper models):
- Classification
- Extraction
- Simple Q&A
- Formatting

**Complex tasks** (worth the premium):
- Multi-step reasoning
- Creative writing
- Code generation
- Strategic analysis

### Strategy 2: Smart Caching (Save 30%)

Cache everything cacheable:

```python
import hashlib
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def cached_llm_call(prompt_hash):
    # Your LLM call here
    pass

def smart_query(prompt):
    # Create deterministic hash of prompt
    prompt_hash = hashlib.md5(prompt.encode()).hexdigest()
    return cached_llm_call(prompt_hash)
```

What to cache:
- Common questions
- Static content analysis
- Classification results
- Embedding vectors

### Strategy 3: Prompt Compression (Save 20%)

Tokens are money. Use fewer.

**Before** (45 tokens):
```
Please analyze the following customer feedback and provide
a detailed summary of the main points, sentiment, and any
actionable insights you can identify:
```

**After** (15 tokens):
```
Summarize feedback: key points, sentiment, actions:
```

### Strategy 4: Batch Processing

Don't make 100 API calls when 1 will do:

```python
# Inefficient: Multiple calls
for item in items:
    response = llm.process(item)

# Efficient: Single batched call
batched_prompt = "\n".join([f"{i}. {item}" for i, item in enumerate(items)])
response = llm.process(batched_prompt)
```

### Strategy 5: Use Embeddings Wisely

For similarity and search, embeddings beat LLMs on cost:
- Embeddings: $0.0001/1K tokens
- GPT-3.5: $0.002/1K tokens (20x more expensive)
- GPT-4: $0.03/1K tokens (300x more expensive)

### Implementation Checklist

**Week 1:**
- [ ] Audit current usage - identify your token hogs
- [ ] Implement model routing for obvious cases
- [ ] Set up basic caching

**Week 2:**
- [ ] Compress your top 10 most-used prompts
- [ ] Batch similar operations
- [ ] Monitor savings

**Week 3:**
- [ ] Move search/similarity to embeddings
- [ ] Fine-tune routing logic based on data
- [ ] Document patterns for your team

### Measuring Success

Track these metrics:
- Cost per 1000 operations
- Average response quality score
- P95 response time
- Cache hit rate

### The Results You Can Expect

Real numbers from teams using this playbook:
- **E-commerce support bot**: 72% cost reduction, quality improved
- **Content generation platform**: 65% savings, 2x faster responses
- **Data analysis tool**: 80% cost cut, same accuracy

### Quick Wins Checklist

Do these today:
1. Find your most expensive prompt
2. Try it with GPT-3.5-Turbo
3. If it works, switch it
4. Pocket the 85% savings

### The Bottom Line

You're leaving money on the table if you're not optimizing LLM costs. These strategies work immediately and stack multiplicatively.

Start with model routing - it's the highest ROI change you can make today.
